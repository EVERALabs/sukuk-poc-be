## Conclusion

Qiro.fi provides excellent UX patterns for DeFi lending that we can adapt for our Sukuk platform. However, our Islamic finance focus requires significant modifications to align with Sharia principles. Our current API already covers the core functionality well, with opportunities for enhanced analytics and user experience features.

**Key Takeaway**: Focus on improving portfolio analytics, activity tracking, and user dashboard features while maintaining our Sukuk-specific Islamic finance compliance requirements.
